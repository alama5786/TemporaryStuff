You want:

✅ Non-Prod (Dev) account to read data from Prod S3
❌ No write access to Prod
✅ Secure cross-account setup

I’ll tell you exactly which policies to create/modify and where.

🎯 What You Need

To allow Dev account to read Prod S3 bucket:

You must configure TWO things:

✅ IAM Role in Dev account

✅ Bucket Policy in Prod account

That’s it.

🟦 STEP 1 — Create IAM Role in DEV Account

In Dev AWS account, create a role:

Example Role Name:
DevIcebergReplicationRole


Attach this IAM policy to it:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ReadProdBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::prod-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::prod-bucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FullAccessToDevBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::nonprod-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::nonprod-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

What this does:

Read from Prod bucket

Full access to Dev bucket

Cannot write to Prod

🟦 STEP 2 — Modify PROD Bucket Policy

Now go to:

Prod Account → S3 → prod-bucket → Permissions → Bucket Policy

Add this statement:

{
  "Sid": "AllowDevAccountReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/DevIcebergReplicationRole"
  },
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::prod-bucket",
    "arn:aws:s3:::prod-bucket/*"
  ]
}


Replace:

<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>


with actual Dev account number.

🔐 If Prod Bucket Uses KMS Encryption (Very Important)

If objects are encrypted with a KMS key, you must also update the KMS key policy in Prod.

Go to:
Prod → KMS → Key used by S3 → Key Policy

Add:

{
  "Sid": "AllowDevAccountDecrypt",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/DevIcebergReplicationRole"
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:Decrypt",
    "kms:DescribeKey"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}


If you skip this, you’ll get:

AccessDenied: KMS Access Denied

🔎 What You DO NOT Need

❌ No need to modify Glue in Prod
❌ No need to allow Prod to access Dev
❌ No need for trust relationship if not assuming cross-account role

This is simple S3 cross-account read.

🧪 How To Test

From Dev account:

aws s3 ls s3://prod-bucket/warehouse/db/table/


If it lists objects → setup is correct.

🔐 Security Best Practice (Recommended)

Instead of giving full bucket access, you can restrict to table path only:

"Resource": [
  "arn:aws:s3:::prod-bucket/warehouse/db/table",
  "arn:aws:s3:::prod-bucket/warehouse/db/table/*"
]


This is more secure for production.

✅ Final Summary

You must change:

Location	What to Change
Dev Account	Create IAM Role with read to prod + write to dev
Prod Account	Add bucket policy allowing that role
Prod KMS (if used)	Allow decrypt permission
