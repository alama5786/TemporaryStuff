Hi Tesh,

We have DDL pipelines for each environment and were running it off of dev which matches up to dwawdbtu733715.
Dev3 matches up to dwawdbtu733706 and I can see that it is working now for the service account.
If you want to confirm, I have ran it currently for BiMetaData - https://controller04.ci.devops.aig.net/job/talbot/job/TALISMAN-7337/job/dev-ci-cd/job/dev3/job/data/job/ddl/job/Talisman-Bimetadata-DB/job/ci-cd-pipeline/

Aziz - Can we please get confirmation on what exact environments need to have DDL pipeliens and what databases should they be pointing too.
As I was led to believe that we need them for each env and the database would match the ones of the dacpac pipelines of the same component.

Regards,
Sean
