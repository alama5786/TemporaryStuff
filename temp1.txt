Hi,

Thanks for your message.

Could you please share a bit more detail? We handle multiple pipelines, repositories, and branches for different teams, so we can’t identify the exact setup without specific information.

Please provide:

* Jenkins pipeline name
* Code repository name
* Branch name

Once we have these details, we’ll make the change.

Thanks,
Aziz
