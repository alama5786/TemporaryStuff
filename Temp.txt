Hi [Manager Name],

Thank you for sharing Chiranjeevi’s profile.

He has strong experience in Release Management, governance, CAB coordination, and Azure DevOps–driven environments. His background in ITIL, change management, and stakeholder communication is solid and well aligned from a process standpoint.

However, for this particular requirement, we are currently looking for a resource with strong hands-on exposure to the technologies we are actively using in our environment — specifically AWS, Jenkins, GitHub, MDS, and SQL Server.

At present, most of the queries coming from BAU and project teams are directly related to these tools. We need someone who can immediately analyze, troubleshoot, and respond confidently. If the person does not already have exposure to these platforms, instead of addressing user queries, the team will first need to spend time training and walking him through the tools and setup, which will impact delivery timelines.

Additionally, this role requires the individual to confidently engage with teams such as AIG Cloud, AIG DevOps, and DBA while discussing environment, deployment, database, and infrastructure-related topics. Practical hands-on experience in our current tech stack is essential for that level of interaction.

From the resume, his primary exposure appears to be around Azure DevOps and release governance, and I do not see strong hands-on experience in AWS, Jenkins, GitHub, MDS, or SQL Server administration/support.

Given the current workload and expectations, we would prefer someone who already has working exposure to these technologies.

Please feel free to share other profiles that are more aligned with the required tech stack.

Regards,
Aziz
