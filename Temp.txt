Support Needed for Setting Up Prod-Like Non-Prod Environment


Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well.

We’re planning to set up a **non-production environment that closely mirrors our production setup**, so teams can test and validate changes safely without impacting prod.

To achieve this, we need to **securely read selected data and metadata from the prod AWS account into the non-prod account**, while ensuring:

* Prod remains read-only and protected
* No write access from non-prod to prod
* Full auditing and least-privilege access

We’d appreciate your support and guidance to help us implement the **right IAM, S3 bucket, and (if required) KMS policies** to enable this in a secure and compliant way.

Happy to walk through the approach and get your recommendations before we proceed.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Aziz
