Hi Team,

Thank you for highlighting the CLR-enabled vulnerability on the regression server.

As previously communicated, we had created a Risk Acceptance (RA) document last year explaining that since we are using SSIS, the execution engine interfaces with the SSIS catalog through CLR-based stored procedures, which must remain enabled during package runtime. The RA document was shared with relevant stakeholders on multiple occasions; however, we did not receive clear guidance on the next steps.

At this stage, we would appreciate your support in advising how and where we can obtain the official RA number for tracking purposes, as requested, so we can formally close this item.

We have been attempting to arrange a discussion since Tuesday but have not yet been able to connect. I have scheduled another call for tomorrow and would be grateful if you could please join and guide us in the right direction to resolve this appropriately.

Thank you for your support.
